<h2>GTWF Timeline 2016-2020</h2>
<h3>The Beginning of GTWF
<span id="date">2016 August</span>
</h3>
    <p>
      The program began as a collaborative undertaking between Dr. Shobha Bhatia (Syracuse University), Dr. Adda Athanapolous-Zekkos (University of Michigan), Dr. Sucheta Soundarajan (Syracuse University) and Dr. Patricia Gallagher (Drexel University). Funding was provided by the U.S. <a href="https://nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a> under <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1536542">the grant #1536542.</a> The aim of GTWF from the beginning has been to empower and support&mdash;primarily but not exclusively&mdash;women geotechnical faculty through peer and mentor collaborative engagement. In short order, the first surveys of GT women faculty were drafted and sent out.
    </p>
<h3>The First Surveys
<span id="date">2017 February</span>
</h3>
    <p>
      Surveys were drafted and sent out to an initial contact list of only a few dozen instructors, largely in research positions at U.S. institutions. The surveys aimed to ask "What challenges do women in the geotechnical field face, and how can they be addressed?" One issue facing geotechnical faculty that was raised again was the issue of professional isolation: in a small field of geographically distant practitioners, chances to network organically are slim.<br>
      Respondents to the first survey were also invited to take part in a multi-day, women-only workshop held in Washington, D.C.
    </p>
<h3>Workshop #1
<span id="date">2017 April</span>
</h3>
    <p>
      Over 60 female geotechnical educators, professors, and researchers attended the first GTWF conference at the NSF in Washington, D.C., <a href="http://suadvance.syr.edu">historical conference papers available here.</a> <a href="http://gtwf.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Working-Agenda-and-Notes-2017-final.pdf">Conference Agenda (PDF)</a>
  <br><br>
  <!-- I know this is a terrible way to display a paragraph , but using <p> here
    will actually cause the label to "ride up" in the final view. So two breaks it is, in the
    interest of things looking nice in the frontend, rather than "proper" coding.

      Attendees participated in workshops from tenured faculty in the geotechnical sciences and beyond, including workshops from professors of economics, business, and geography that focused on networking-as-practice, benefits of social mentorship, and more.
    </p>
<h3>Workshop #1 Feedback
<span id="date">2017 May</span>
</h3>
    <p>
      Feedback was collected from participants at the first workshop, with many expressing a wish for more collaborative efforts. GTWF determined that the best way to support networking and mentorship was to provide seed grants towards that end. Seed grants allowed decentralized and flexible support in pursuit of a common goal&mdash;rather than a single centralized conference system, seed grant recipients would be able to use the funds in their own pursuit of collaboration, mentorship, and success.
    </p>
<h3>Seed Grants Round I; Survey 2
<span id="date">2017 June</span>
</h3>
    <p>
      At this point, the GTWF project was able to secure additional funding that would be put towards providing seed grants&mdash;and the first call for proposals was put out in late summer. The reports are required as a component of the GTWF process, and are integrated into the larger, final project that will be presented to the NSF at the close of the program.
    </p>
<h3>Workshop #2 & Feedback
<span id="date">2018 March</span>
</h3>
    <p>
      GTWF hosted a second Workshop Conference, this time in Orlando, FL, USA. The second workshop was open to male and female participants, and again drew around 60 geotechnical experts from higher education. With a mission to &quot;identify characteristics and practices that heighten the chances of collaborative success when working with other scientists,&quot; attendees were encouraged to pursue networks after and beyond the conference itself.
      <br><br>
      An initial round of seed grants was offered in late spring, with 20 groups being awarded small sums to "pursue collaboration and community for geotechnical women faculty." Grants were distributed by GTWF Program with funding from the NSF.
  </p>
<h3>Semi-Structured Interviews
<span id="date">2019 January</span>
</h3>
      Seed grant recipients completed research, collaborative, and networking activities as part of their projects, and submitted final reports to GTWF. The PIs of each group were also interviewed by GTWF researchers (via web or phone call) using a semi-structured format that was quantitatively coded and analyzed.
      <br><br>
     From the interviews it was learned that, for many attendees, the opportunity to gather with other geotechnical specialists led to greater comfort within the community, and identification of common ground.
    </p>
<h3>Seed Grands Round II Applications
<span id="date">2019 November</span>
</h3>
      [In-Progress]
      After being renewed for another year in the summer of 2019, GTWF <a href="http://gtwf.syr.edu/seed-grant-round-2/">issued calls for a second round of seed grant funding</a>. Applications are accepted from December 10, 2019 to January 30, 2020 on a rolling basis. Ten seed grants will be awarded to projects that assist junior faculty in the geotechnical field build connections, collaborate on projects, and seek out mentorship. Groups are required to be at least 1/3 female in PI compositon.
    </p>
<h3>Seed Grants Round II
<span id="date">2020 January - April</span>
</h3>
      [In-Progress]<br>
      Seed grants will be finalized after 10 have been awarded, and will proceed until April of 2020, when preliminary results and reports from recipients are turned in to GTWF for review.
    </p>
<h3>Semi-Structured Interviews II
<span id="date">2020 Spring</span>
</h3>
      [In-Progress]<br>
      Recipients will be asked to participate in a short (60-90 minute) interview that will be analyzed and incorporated into the GTWF final report.
    </p>
<h3>Project Report Final Paper
<span id="date">2020 Summer</span>
</h3>
      [In-Progress]<br>
      The GTWF final report will exit the draft phase in early summer 2020, and will be submitted to the NSF and for publishing. All participants will recieve a digital copy, and may be able to request a hard copy.
    </p>
<h3>The Work is Ongoing
<span id="date">The Future Indefinite</span>

      "Intellectual freedom requires intellectual work." &nbsp;&nbsp; - H.G. Creel
      <br>
      "If nature is unjust, change nature." &nbsp;&nbsp; - Laboria Cuboniks
      <br><br>
      The work of ensuring an equitable and just today and tomorrow is ongoing. While great strides have been made in recent decades, many fields including geotechnical engineering have a long way to go to reach gender parity that is representative of the larger population.<br>
      It is the hope of GTWF that such a day is not far off. We believe that, provided commitment to respect, diversity, and support, such a day is not only possible, but certain.
